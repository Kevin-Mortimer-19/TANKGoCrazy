When fired, bullets would continue to rotate with the player's gun

This was because they were being added as children of the gun, and inheriting its rotation value

I fixed it by instantiating them as children to the root node for the level.

Once I did that, the bullets appeared at the upper left corner, instead of the gun's barrel.

This is because I was using the relative position of the gun's barrel, which didn't include its parent (the player)'s position

using the gun barrel's global position fixed the last of the issues
